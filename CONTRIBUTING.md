## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features

- Use meaningful variable names
- Include JSDoc comments for functions

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Deletes a single tweet by clicking through the UI
 * @param {HTMLElement} button - The "More" button element
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} True if deleted successfully
 */
async function deleteTweet(button) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

**Examples:**
```
feat: Add batch size configuration option
fix: Handle edge case when confirm button missing
docs: Update installation instructions
refactor: Simplify deletion loop logic
```
